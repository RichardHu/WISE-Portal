whatiswiseheader=What is WISE?
whatiswisebullet=The Web-based Inquiry Science Environment fosters inquiry-oriented science using richly interactive, research-supported learning technologies. Students observe, analyze, and reflect as they explore WISE projects. Teachers facilitate and offer formative and evaluative assessment to students using a suite of online tools.
aboutwise=This site hosts the latest and most powerful version of WISE (v4.0).  Classic WISE (v2.0) can be accessed at wise2.berkeley.edu.
curriculumbasedheader=Curriculum-Based
curriculumbasedbullet=Standards-based WISE projects are specifically tailored for classroom use, and revolve around key conceptual difficulties that students encounter in biology, chemistry, and physics.  As a result, WISE projects offer a focused and inquiry-rich supplement to a teacher's core scope and sequence.
inquiryprojectsheader=Inquiry Projects
inquiryprojectsbullet=WISE projects focus on science inquiry. Students explore new ideas and information, ponder discrepant events, write reflections, form fact-based theories, and validate these theories through discussion and model-based testing. Students can work alone, in pairs, or in trios (at the teacher's discretion).
studentengagementheader=Student Engagement
studentengagementbullet=WISE projects draw and sustain student interest using compelling computer-based interactivity. The rapid feedback offered by WISE tools encourages students to self-monitor their progress and solidify their new ideas before moving onward.
interactivemodelsheader=Interactive Models
interactivemodelsbullet=Many WISE projects incorporate interactive models that help make micro and macro scientific concepts both visible and testable.  Students experience the core processes of the scientific method as they form hypotheses, test them, analyze results, refine ideas, and retest.
teachertoolsheader=Teacher Tools
teachertoolsbullet=A variety of integrated tools help teachers grade efficiently (using editable comment templates), pause all student computers simultaneously (for group discussion), and watch student work unfold online in real-time (with the Class Monitor). Teachers can also create customized projects using the powerful Authoring Tool.
freeandopensourceheader=Free & Open Source
freeandopensourcebullet=Best of all, WISE is completely free.  Emerging from education research funding, and based on modern open-source technology, WISE is an active, on-going research tool used by an international community of teachers, researchers and software developers.

teacher.termsofuse.3=The following information describes terms of use for the WISE 4.0 system.
teacher.termsofuse.4=Usage Agreement
teacher.termsofuse.5=Before proceeding, we would like to explain our community and the role you'll play within the WISE research environment.  Please take a moment to read this page, as it is very important.
teacher.termsofuse.6=By joining the WISE Online Community, you are joining a community that serves several federally-funded research projects, and we seek your consent to use your contributions to this community as part of this research.  We may use your comments, communities, or surveys in our research, and we will keep track of some of your actions on our site to help us find ways to improve.  In addition, your students' work (free from identification) may be analyzed to address research questions about the effectiveness of specific curriculum content or elements of the online environment.
teacher.termsofuse.7=By checking the "I agree to the terms of use" box on the registration page, you will be consenting to participation in our research regarding teacher and scientist beliefs about technology and the Internet, as well as best ways to support community members as they prepare to use WISE projects and author WISE curricula.  You also consent to our use in our research of your written contributions to surveys and community discussions.  If participating in specific research projects that use the WISE platform, you consent to using WISE as part of these project-specific materials.
teacher.termsofuse.8=We do not anticipate risks related to teachers and students joining the WISE community other than those inherent to the web itself -- namely the possible exploration of indecent or inappropriate material on unrelated websites.  This risk is handled at school sites, which have security/filtering systems.  WISE benefits from these security systems and our curriculum provides structure and content that reduces the risk of haphazard searching.
teacher.termsofuse.9=We will not release your identify in any of our research.  Likewise, your students' identities will never be viewed or revealed.  All community comments will be treated as anonymous in our analyses.  Anytime we seek to use your identity in conjunction with comments (e.g., as a teacher quote on our public pages), we will first seek your permission.
teacher.termsofuse.10A=In the interest of intellectual freedom, WISE allows members to contribute comments and links to public spaces, but to function as a community we insist that users be considerate and respectful of one another.  If you find any content posted by another WISE member to be offensive or inappropriate, please contact WISE support
teacher.termsofuse.10B=contact WISE
teacher.termsofuse.10C=and we will investigate.  Users who abuse their WISE membership privileges may have their accounts terminated.
teacher.termsofuse.11=Finally, your participation in the WISE community is voluntary, and you are free to halt your WISE membership at any time.
teacher.termsofuse.12=We value your enthusiastic participation in the WISE community and its related research endeavors.  If you have any questions about our research or policies, please contact our project directors.
teacher.termsofuse.13=Sincerely,
teacher.termsofuse.14=Marcia Linn, Project Director

Search the Project Library for details. In addition, WISE projects can be translated into virtually any language. If you see an English-only project that you would like to translate, read on.
teacher.pro.translations.3=Getting Started:
teacher.pro.translations.4=We really love to hear from teachers and academics in foreign nations who are interested in using WISE projects. Contact us and we can bring our knowledge of English-speaking cultural issues to bear on your translation efforts. We can also put our technical resources at your disposal and look for ways to establish WISE in your country.
teacher.pro.translations.5=Translating a Project:
teacher.pro.translations.6=In the My Customized Projects area you can duplicate any WISE library project and customize it to your language. You can edit each step of a project, translating all text. Remember, however, that outside web pages linked to a project aren't controlled by the WISE site, and therefore are not always available for translation. You may need to search for web pages in your language that have similar content. Also, there is always a chance that cultural differences will need to be taken into account when using a project. If you ask us, we can help address those issues.
teacher.pro.translations.7=The WISE Interface:
teacher.pro.translations.8=Many of the interface controls and mouse-over tool tips in WISE v3.0 display English words. These can also be translated by sending a list of requests to the WISE engineering staff.
teacher.pro.translations.9=If you want to get started on a translation or have any other questions, please contact WISE and we would be happy to guide you through the translation process.
