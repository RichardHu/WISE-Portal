whatiswiseheader=What is WISE?
whatiswisebullet=The Web-based Inquiry Science Environment is a research-based digital learning platform that fosters exploration and science inquiry.  Students observe, analyze, experiment, and reflect as they navigate WISE projects. Teachers guide and evaluate the process using a suite of classroom-based and online tools.
whatiswisebullet2=This site hosts the latest and most powerful version of WISE &mdash; version 4.0.  Classic WISE can be accessed at <a href='http://wise.berkeley.edu' target='_blank'>http://wise.berkeley.edu</a>.
aboutwise=This site hosts the latest and most powerful version of WISE (v4.0).  Classic WISE (v2.0) can be accessed at wise2.berkeley.edu.
curriculumbasedheader=Curriculum-Based
curriculumbasedbullet=Standards-based WISE projects are specifically tailored for classroom use, and revolve around key conceptual difficulties that students encounter in biology, chemistry, and physics.  As a result, WISE projects offer a focused and inquiry-rich supplement to a teacher's core scope and sequence.
inquiryprojectsheader=Inquiry Projects
inquiryprojectsbullet=WISE projects focus on science inquiry. Students explore new ideas and information, ponder discrepant events, write reflections, form fact-based theories, and validate these theories through discussion and model-based testing. Students can work alone, in pairs, or in trios (at the teacher's discretion).
studentengagementheader=Student Engagement
studentengagementbullet=WISE projects draw and sustain student interest using compelling computer-based interactivity. The rapid feedback offered by WISE tools encourages students to self-monitor their progress and solidify their new ideas before moving onward.
interactivemodelsheader=Interactive Models
interactivemodelsbullet=Many WISE projects incorporate interactive models that help make micro and macro scientific concepts both visible and testable.  Students experience the core processes of the scientific method as they form hypotheses, test them, analyze results, refine ideas, and retest.	  				
teachertoolsheader=Teacher Tools
teachertoolsbullet=A variety of integrated tools help teachers grade efficiently (using editable comment templates), pause all student computers simultaneously (for group discussion), and watch student work unfold online in real-time (with the Class Monitor). Teachers can also create customized projects using the powerful Authoring Tool.  				
freeandopensourceheader=Free & Open Source
freeandopensourcebullet=Best of all, WISE is completely free.  Emerging from education research funding, and based on modern open-source technology, WISE is an active, on-going research tool used by an international community of teachers, researchers and software developers.

teacher.termsofuse.1=Terms of Use
teacher.termsofuse.2=WISE Usage Agreement
teacher.termsofuse.3=The following information describes terms of use for the WISE system.
teacher.termsofuse.4=Usage Agreement
teacher.termsofuse.5=Before proceeding, we would like to explain our community and the role you'll play within the WISE research environment.  Please take a moment to read this page, as it is very important.  
teacher.termsofuse.6=By joining the WISE Online Community, you are joining a community that serves several federally-funded research projects, and we seek your consent to use your contributions to this community as part of this research.  We may use your comments, communities, or surveys in our research, and we will keep track of some of your actions on our site to help us find ways to improve.  In addition, your students' work (free from identification) may be analyzed to address research questions about the effectiveness of specific curriculum content or elements of the online environment.  
teacher.termsofuse.7=By checking the "I agree to the terms of use" box on the registration page, you will be consenting to participation in our research regarding teacher and scientist beliefs about technology and the Internet, as well as best ways to support community members as they prepare to use WISE projects and author WISE curricula.  You also consent to our use in our research of your written contributions to surveys and community discussions.  If participating in specific research projects that use the WISE platform, you consent to using WISE as part of these project-specific materials.   
teacher.termsofuse.8=We do not anticipate risks related to teachers and students joining the WISE community other than those inherent to the web itself -- namely the possible exploration of indecent or inappropriate material on unrelated websites.  This risk is handled at school sites, which have security/filtering systems.  WISE benefits from these security systems and our curriculum provides structure and content that reduces the risk of haphazard searching. 
teacher.termsofuse.9=We will not release your identify in any of our research.  Likewise, your students' identities will never be viewed or revealed.  All community comments will be treated as anonymous in our analyses.  Anytime we seek to use your identity in conjunction with comments (e.g., as a teacher quote on our public pages), we will first seek your permission. 
teacher.termsofuse.10A=In the interest of intellectual freedom, WISE allows members to contribute comments and links to public spaces, but to function as a community we insist that users be considerate and respectful of one another.  If you find any content posted by another WISE member to be offensive or inappropriate, please contact WISE support
teacher.termsofuse.10B=contact WISE
teacher.termsofuse.10C=and we will investigate.  Users who abuse their WISE membership privileges may have their accounts terminated.   
teacher.termsofuse.11=Finally, your participation in the WISE community is voluntary, and you are free to halt your WISE membership at any time.
teacher.termsofuse.12=We value your enthusiastic participation in the WISE community and its related research endeavors.  If you have any questions about our research or policies, please contact our project director. 
teacher.termsofuse.13=Sincerely, 
teacher.termsofuse.14=Marcia Linn, Project Director

teacher.pro.translations.2=Interested in having your students experience a WISE project in a language other than English? Several WISE projects are currently available in non-English languages. Search the Project Library for details. In addition, WISE projects can be translated into virtually any language. If you see an English-only project that you would like to translate, read on.
teacher.pro.translations.3=Getting Started:
teacher.pro.translations.4=We really love to hear from teachers and academics in foreign nations who are interested in using WISE projects. Contact us and we can bring our knowledge of English-speaking cultural issues to bear on your translation efforts. We can also put our technical resources at your disposal and look for ways to establish WISE in your country.
teacher.pro.translations.5=Translating a Project:
teacher.pro.translations.6=In the My Customized Projects area you can duplicate any WISE library project and customize it to your language. You can edit each step of a project, translating all text. Remember, however, that outside web pages linked to a project aren't controlled by the WISE site, and therefore are not always available for translation. You may need to search for web pages in your language that have similar content. Also, there is always a chance that cultural differences will need to be taken into account when using a project. If you ask us, we can help address those issues.
teacher.pro.translations.7=The WISE Interface:
teacher.pro.translations.8=Many of the interface controls and mouse-over tool tips in WISE v3.0 display English words. These can also be translated by sending a list of requests to the WISE engineering staff.
teacher.pro.translations.9=If you want to get started on a translation or have any other questions, please contact WISE and we would be happy to guide you through the translation process.

teacherfaq.title=WISE Teacher Frequently Asked Questions
teacherfaq.student-management=Student Management
teacherfaq.register-student-q=Should I register my students for WISE or have them do it themselves?
teacherfaq.register-student-a1=WISE makes student registration simple and intuitive -- direct your student to the the WISE4 home page and provide them with their Access Code, and they should be able to register in 10 minutes or less.   However, you can also opt to pre-register all of your students and provide them with a copy of their Username/Password on their first day in the project run.
teacherfaq.register-student-a2=Once a student has created a WISE 4 account they should never need to create another one.
teacherfaq.register-student-a3=Some teachers that pre-register prefer to give all students the same initial password, to decrease problems with students signing.  Note that students can later change their password if they so desire.
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-q=A student has forgotten his/her Username or Password.  What should I do?
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-a1=First, we recommend always having students WRITE DOWN their Username/Password when they first register.
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-a2=Second, encourage the students to solve the problem themselves.  Tell them to go to the WISE4 home page, click the Lost UserName /Password link, and click the Student button.  If the student can answer their security question (created at registration) they can reassign their password.  If the student has the Access Code they should be able to find their Username associated with the project run.
teacherfaq.student-forgets-username-a3=Third, if the student can't solve the problem directly, you can look up their Username or change their Password.  On the Teacher Dashboard home page click a link in the student column a particular period in a particular project run.  Click the Info button to see the student's Username.   Click Password to assign the student a new password.
teacherfaq.change-team-q=How do I change a student team after they've started a project run?
teacherfaq.change-team-a1=Sign into using your teacher Username/Password.
teacherfaq.change-team-a2=Find the project run in the list of active projects.
teacherfaq.change-team-a3=Click the link for registered students in a particular period of a particular project run.  This will take you to the student management for that class period.
teacherfaq.change-team-a4=Drag-and-drop student names to move them from one team to another.  Make sure to save your changes before leaving this window.
teacherfaq.change-team-a5=If you want to move students into a brand new team, click New Team, then drag 1 or more students into the new team.  Save your changes.
teacherfaq.change-team-a6=Note 1: If you move Student A into an established team, student A loses all of their current work and inherits the current work of the established team.
teacherfaq.change-team-a7=Note 2: If you move Student A into a newly created (blank) team, student A will carry along their current work into the new blank team.
teacherfaq.change-team-a8=Note 3: If you move Student A into a newly created (blank) team, student A will carry along their current work into the new blank team.  If you then move Student B into the team, Student B will lose any of their current work and will inherit the current work of the team (which at this point is Student A's work).
teacherfaq.change-student-password-q=How do I change a student's password?
teacherfaq.change-student-password-a1=You can tell the student to change their password manually.  They should sign in using their Username/Password, then click Change Password button, then create a new password.
teacherfaq.change-student-password-a2=Or you can change a password for a student directly.
teacherfaq.change-student-password-a3=Sign in with your teacher Username/Password.
teacherfaq.change-student-password-a4=Click the student link for a particular period of a particular project run.  This will take you to the student management for that class period.
teacherfaq.change-student-password-a5=Click Password link for a particular student to change the password for that student.
teacherfaq.change-student-password-a6=Or click the Change All Passwords link to batch change the password for ALL students in the current class periods (the new password will be applied to all the students).
teacherfaq.forgot-access-code-q=I forgot the student Access Code for my project run.  What do I do?
teacherfaq.forgot-access-code-a1=Sign in with your teacher Username/Password.
teacherfaq.forgot-access-code-a2=Look in the table of active project runs on the right side of the screen.
teacherfaq.forgot-access-code-a3=Each project run displays its unique Access Code.  This is the code students will need to register for your project run.
teacherfaq.project-management=Project Management
teacherfaq.when-set-up-run-q=When should I set up my project run?
teacherfaq.when-set-up-run-a=You need to set up your project run prior to the students signing in, in order to generate an Access Code.   Students cannot register for your project run until you provide them with its Access Code.
teacherfaq.how-long-run-project-q=How long does it take to run a project?
teacherfaq.how-long-run-project-a=Project durations vary from about 3 days to 10 days. See the information panel for a project for more details.  Note that some WISE4 projects may differ in their Total Time (the expected hours to complete the entire project) versus the Computer Time (the expected hours of active time on the computer; some projects will include paper-based activities for some days).
teacherfaq.can-shorten-run-q=Can I shorten a project run to 1 or 2 days?
teacherfaq.can-shorten-run-a=It is not a good idea to shorten a project. Each project has been carefully designed to lead the student through an inquiry process and cutting it short will result in a less satisfactory educational student experience.
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-q=How do I review and grade student work?
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-a1=Sign in with your teacher Username/Password.
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-a2=Look in the table of active project runs on the right side of the screen.
teacherfaq.review-grade-work-a3=Click the Grade by Step or Grade by Teamlink for a particular project run.  The following screens will present all current student work (with color highlighting of new/revised work).  You can make comments which the student will see inside their MY WORK panel.  You can also score student work.
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-q=How do students see my comments and scores for their work?
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-a1=Have the student sign in using their Username/Password.
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-a2=Have the student click Run Project for your project run.
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-a3=Once the project has completed loading, have the student click the My Work button at the top of the screen.
teacherfaq.students-see-comments-a4=The My Work screen presents a summary of their current score, and a listing of all their work  (written text, drawings, diagrams, etc).   Teachers comments/score are displayed per work item.
teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-q=Where do I find out about lesson plans and standards for WISE 4 projects?
teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-a1=Click PROJECT button, then click Browse TELS Library.  Select a particular project by clicking on its blue title.  Click the "Project Info" tab to review the lessons plans for the project.
teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-a2=How do I fit a WISE project into my curriculum?
teacherfaq.where-lesson-plan-a3=In general students will benefit from some pre-teaching of the topic covered in the project. It is really up to the teacher to decide where it best fits to support student learning. Many teachers use a WISE project as a capstone activity while others integrate it into their curriculum at a midpoint. Some teachers elect to use WISE projects an introductory activity for a unit, or as a summation activity for a unit.
teacherfaq.out-of-time-q=What if I run out of computer lab time but some of my students are not finished with the project?
teacherfaq.out-of-time-a1=WISE is a web-based learning environments, so students can sign in from a computer at school or at home.  This means that students can complete the project from any home or community based computer, per the teacher's discretion.
teacherfaq.forgot-access-code-q=I do not remember my teacher access code that students need to create their account for my new students.
teacherfaq.forgot-access-code-a=To get the project run code for students you will find it when you login and look at your list of project runs. It is one of the pieces of information given for each run you have set up. Remember that you must first set up a run before having your students create a new account.
teacherfaq.nav-bar-disappear-q=Often the navigation bar on the left side of the page is disappearing on students' screens. What are they doing that is making this happen, and how do I get it back?
teacherfaq.nav-bar-disappear-a=When the students are running the project there is a button at the top of the page labeled "Full Screen". When you click on it the project page takes the the full area doing away with the navigation bar.  The students then use the green arrows (top left) to navigate. Clicking on it again will bring back the navigation bar.
teacherfaq.assess-student-work=Assessment of Student Work
teacherfaq.where-is-student-work-q=Where do I find my students' work?
teacherfaq.where-is-student-work-a1=Sign into the Teacher Dashboard using your Username/Password.
teacherfaq.where-is-student-work-a2=Select any Grade by Step or Grade by Team link for a project run shown in the table to the right.
teacherfaq.rubric-q=What should I look for in my student's answers?
teacherfaq.rubric-a1=The following link will give you a sample rubric for grading a step in the Mitosis and Cell Processes project. The rubric is based on our TELS Center research on how students integrate their knowledge of complex science concepts. We hope that it can give you a start in developing your own rubrics for the notes and steps you plan to grade.
teacherfaq.rubric-a2=Sample rubric for assessing student work
teacherfaq.encorage-students-review-q=How can I encourage my students to review the graded notes and comments I have made?
teacherfaq.encorage-students-review-a=Many teachers find it advantageous to grade the first step or two at the end of the first day of the project run. At the beginning of class the next day they share with the whole class some sample responses and have the class critique the work. Then when the students sign in they are directed to go to the My Work link before starting on the project to review your comments and grades.
teacherfaq.find-time-grade-q=How do I find time to grade all of the student work?
teacherfaq.find-time-grade-a1=We recommend that you go through the project and select a few steps that you think best demonstrate the students' understanding of the complex concepts covered in the module. You can then go to the Gradinglink and edit the Point Values for each question.   For example, you could most steps in the project worth just 1-2 pts while a few key steps are worth 20 points.  Then tell your students they must complete all questions but should concentrate their efforts on the key questions.  We recognize that critically grading each step is very time consuming.
teacherfaq.technical-questions=Technical Questions
teacherfaq.technical-questions-q=The WISE 4 web site won't load on my web browser.  What do I do?
teacherfaq.technical-questions-a1=Confirm that your are using the Firefox web browser, with Javascript set to on in the preferences panel.

teacherfaq.technical-questions-a2=You might also need to clear your cache if you see the browser freezing up. Follow instructions on this page:
teacherfaq.how-to-clear-cache=How to clear your cache (opens in new tab)
teacherfaq.wise-2-q=Can I run my WISE 2.0 projects in the new WISE 4.0 format?
teacherfaq.wise-2-a1=At the present time if you are running a WISE 2.0 project you will need to user the older WISE 2.0 environment.  (http://wise.berkeley.edu)
teacherfaq.wise-2-a2=You can also contact us to request a conversion of your WISE2 project into the new WISE 4 format.
teacherfaq.wise-2-a3=We hope to offer an automated tool that will allow WISE2 users to convert their projects to the WISE4 format.
teacherfaq.num-computers-q=How many computers do I need to run WISE?
teacherfaq.num-computers-a1=We strongly recommend one computer for each two students. We know from research that students benefit from working together as a team of two.
teacherfaq.trouble-logging-in-q=What if I have trouble logging in?
teacherfaq.trouble-logging-in-a1=If you do not remember your Username or password click the Lost Username or Password link and follow the instructions.  Note that your Username does not include a space between first and last name (unlike WISE 2). 
teacherfaq.trouble-logging-in-a2=You will also want to turn off any firewall software that may be blocking your access to the site.
teacherfaq.contact-q=Who do I contact when I have a problem I can't solve?
teacherfaq.contact-a=The Contact WISE link under the Quick Links on the WISE4 Homepage will send an email to the WISE technology group. Be sure to include as much information as you can about the problem. We will respond as quickly as we can.
