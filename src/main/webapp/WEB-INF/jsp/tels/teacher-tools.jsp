							<p>To guide students through inquiry-based WISE curricula, teachers survey students' ideas on an individual or small group basis and periodically address the whole class about course content. WISE provides teachers with a suite of integrated tools for efficiently managing and promoting student learning with WISE. Teachers monitor students' real-time progress, provide immediate feedback on student work, and grade more efficiently using automated scoring systems. </p>
							<p>By more effectively facilitating classroom management tasks, teachers are free to focus on diverse students' learning needs by interacting with individual students and gaining insights about classroom learning as a whole.</p>
							<p>WISE provides a wide range of one-week long inquiry units that address key concepts consistent with California and national standards. WISE units can not only fit with teachers' excising curricula across science topics, but can also be specifically customized for classroom use.</p>
