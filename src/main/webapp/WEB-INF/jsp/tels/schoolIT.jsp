<h1>Resources for technicians and network administrators at schools running WISE projects</h1>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<div>This page is for technicians and network administrators at schools that are running WISE projects. 
We hope this will help you learn more about the WISE technology and what is needed to run WISE in schools.
Thank you for all that you do to make technology work in schools!</div>

<h3>Computer System and Network requirements to run WISE4</h3>
We've provided a <a href="../check.html">compatibility checker</a> that will run some scripts to help you determine if the computers at your school(s) are
capable of running WISE4 projects. This page also includes a section on computer system requirements to run WISE4 projects.

<h3>About WISE</h3>
The Web-based Inquiry Science Environment is a research-based digital learning platform that fosters exploration and science inquiry. 
Students observe, analyze, experiment, and reflect as they navigate WISE projects. 
Teachers guide and evaluate the process using a suite of classroom-based and online tools.
WISE is supported by the National Science Founation, TELS Grant No. 0334199.
